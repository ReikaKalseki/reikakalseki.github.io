			<!-- <h2>FAQ</h2> -->

	<h3>GENERAL</h3>
		<h4 class = "faq-entry" style = "margin-top: 0px;">"Do your mods work in X version of the game/with X DLC?"</h4>
		That depends on the mod. The Aleran Commonwealth definitely not with any modern version; it needs some scripting and event changes. E:D Star names probably does; name lists have not changed much if at all. As for DLCs...<i>probably</i>. I cannot speak for, much less design with and against, DLCs I do not have, but in general I doubt that adding new DLCs would outright break something.
		<h4 class = "faq-entry" style = "margin-top: 18px;">"When will Dragon Species and Aleran Commonwealth be re-released?"</h4>
		This is dependent upon A) updating to a new game version and B) finding new portrait graphics. The former is somewhat tedious but definitely achievable, but I have not been motivated to do so until I can also solve the latter. I do not have a good source of new graphics that I can be sure will not incur new copyright issues, and I do not have the artistic skill to make some. Additionally, I never really liked the lack of animation on them, and have been debating trying to make animated versions (since those are apparently not full 3D models, but just a handful of 2D parts animated independently). In other words, it will happen when those issues are solved, which is not something I have a specific timeframe for, but is not likely to be THAT far in the future.

<section class = "textblock" id = "text-block-issues">
	<h3>ISSUES</h3>
		<h4 class = "faq-entry" style = "margin-top: 0px;">"I do not see any E:D star names! Your mod does not work!"</h4>
		Are you <i>sure</i>? The vast majority of names from E:D and thus the mod are not very recognizable; the odds of finding a very well-known system (Lave, Sothis, Diaguandri, Shinrarta Dezhra, etc) are not very high when those number in the few dozen at most and there are 15000 names to choose from. Generate a handful of large galaxies; you should see a great many names you have never seen before.
</section><br>
<section class = "textblock" id = "text-block-commentary">
	<h3>COMMENTARY</h3>
		<h4 class = "faq-entry" style = "margin-top: 0px;">"Alerans are stupidly overpowered!"</h4>
		One, Alerans are balanced against the bonuses the genocidal empires get, which was the inception of the whole mod; those empires are notoriously overpowered - to such a degree that the "I spawned near a determined exterminator, time for a new save" meme still dominates most stellaris communities - but my mod is just an answer to that. And no, the diplomatic maluses those empires have do not negate the bonuses; neither players nor AI usually attempt to pick a fight with an empire with seven times their fleet strength and five times their economy. Two, the bonuses the Alerans receive only apply in a very narrow playstyle; they cannot be co-opted to aid in more general play, including the ways which are the most popular and often most convenient. Three, those bonuses come with significant downsides, which culminate in a much harder time reaching victory compared to a vanilla empire. How can something be OP if it makes ultimate victory <i>harder</i>?

		If you like any of my mods, maps, or other content, or want to help me develop them, feel free to use my Patreon or the buttons below. Every little bit helps me be able to keep working on them, and helps ensure both maintenance and expansion of them.<br>
		If you wish to give a one-time donation, I recommend you use the Paypal link on the right; Patreon, though it can be used for one-time donations, is designed for ongoing monthly 'subscriptions' (ie a set amount of money gifted each month for as long as you remain a 'patron'). Paypal can also register a donation with monthly recurrence, should that seem preferable to you.<br>
		For both systems, the amount you choose to donate is up to you, and for Patreon, can be changed at any time should you wish to decrease or increase the amount.<br>
		And thank you for your support. :D<br>
