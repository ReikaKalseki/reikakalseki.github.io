			<section class = "textblock" id = "text-block-general">
	<h3>GENERAL</h3>
		<h4 class = "faq-entry" style = "margin-top: 0px;">"I want to do a mod spotlight. Can I?"</h4>
		Of course! I always appreciate spotlights, and am willing to work with you to ensure their accuracy and thoroughness.
		<h4 class = "faq-entry" style = "margin-top: 18px;">"Can I use this mod in a modpack?"</h4>
		Yes, provided that you do not take credit for or monetize my content. Additionally, please do not reupload my mods to the mods portal; that makes version control impossible.
		<h4 class = "faq-entry" style = "margin-top: 18px;">"Does your mod work with X mod?"</h4>
		There are many mods I have never used, so I cannot tell you offhand without reports from other users. A general rule of thumb often proves accurate: Is the mod small and/or only has a few features that have nothing to do with the mod of mine in question? If so, a conflict is possible, but very unlikely. Larger mods affect more things, and thus are more able to have gameplay (balance, progression, etc) or compatibility issues. Conflicts are still generally rare. Additionally, for many popular mods, I am either an avid user of them myself or add various compatibility patches.In practice, that means the major, famous overhaul mods - AAI, Bob's, Angels, et cetera - are by far the most likely to have issues. I often play with Bob's, and try to have a great deal of interaction, but I cannot guarantee functionality for any arbitrary version. As of September 2020, I can also confirm that my mods worked - at least in the "game can be played" sense - with Space Exploration and Angels. Due to the sheer number of changes they make, this may not be true forever.
</section><br>
<section class = "textblock" id = "text-block-issues">
	<h3>ISSUES</h3>
		<h4 class = "faq-entry" style = "margin-top: 0px;">"[CHOKEPOINT] This mod causes worldgen lag!"</h4>
		Chokepoint uses complex noise algorithms to create its channels; this is much more expensive than the native Factorio worldgen (which is not readily made compatible with custom generation algorithms - trust me, I tried). Additionally, due to the way Factorio generates terrain, even after the map appears generated, some smaller and variable lag will continue for some time, as there remains ongoing worldgen in the background, beyond the visible area on the map.
</section><br>
<section class = "textblock" id = "text-block-features">
	<h3>FEATURES</h3>
		<h4 class = "faq-entry" style = "margin-top: 0px;">"[ENDGAMECOMBAT] This mod is overpowered!"</h4>
		I do have a slightly unusual definition of balance. To me, no feature is inherently overpowered, it just needs to have a cost/progression/risk to compensate it. So some things in some mods might seem grossly overpowered, but I suggest trying to obtain them in survival before passing judgement. I am open to feedback - especially in the form of a setting, rather than a de facto change - within reasonable limits (ie feature removal is rarely something considered, even as an option).
		<h4 class = "faq-entry" style = "margin-top: 18px;">"[FASTFURNACES] This mod is overpowered!"</h4>
		Yes, this mod definitely is, especially with the higher tier modules enabled. That was kind of the whole point, having grown from a "higher tier machines" mod (itself based on the kind seen in Bob's mods).

		If you like any of my mods, maps, or other content, or want to help me develop them, feel free to use my Patreon or the buttons below. Every little bit helps me be able to keep working on them, and helps ensure both maintenance and expansion of them.<br>
		If you wish to give a one-time donation, I recommend you use the Paypal link on the right; Patreon, though it can be used for one-time donations, is designed for ongoing monthly 'subscriptions' (ie a set amount of money gifted each month for as long as you remain a 'patron'). Paypal can also register a donation with monthly recurrence, should that seem preferable to you.<br>
		For both systems, the amount you choose to donate is up to you, and for Patreon, can be changed at any time should you wish to decrease or increase the amount.<br>
		And thank you for your support. :D<br>
