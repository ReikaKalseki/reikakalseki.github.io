<h3>Introduction</h3>
These are the changelogs for all the mods going back as far as they have been kept, sorted by game and mod version. Click a button to load the changes made in that version; the presence of any mod and its changes in the displayed data can be toggled with the options below.<br><br>Note that I have not always kept changelogs, nor equally good ones; as you go back, changelogs may be missing data such as their release date or game version, or even be absent entirely. This also means the "Game Version" ranges below may not be fully accurate for the earliest releases, which may predate any changelog efforts, and where manual reconstruction was attempted. Furthermore, where I have record of changes but incomplete record of releases, the changes will be attributed to the soonest release after the change I can confirm, which may not be the actual release date of that change.<br><br>Finally, the display data you see here is autogenerated by parsing existing written changelogs in other forms, and as such I cannot guarantee that it not have the occasional error such as a missing change or incorrect date ranges in the table below.

		If you wish to give a one-time donation, I recommend you use the Paypal link on the right; Patreon, though it can be used for one-time donations, is designed for ongoing monthly 'subscriptions' (ie a set amount of money gifted each month for as long as you remain a 'patron'). Paypal can also register a donation with monthly recurrence, should that seem preferable to you.<br>
		For both systems, the amount you choose to donate is up to you, and for Patreon, can be changed at any time should you wish to decrease or increase the amount.<br>
