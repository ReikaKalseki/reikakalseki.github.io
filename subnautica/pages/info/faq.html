			<section class = "textblock" id = "text-block-general">
	<h3>GENERAL</h3>
		<h4 class = "faq-entry" style = "margin-top: 0px;">"I want to do a mod spotlight. Can I?"</h4>
		Of course! I always appreciate spotlights, and am willing to work with you to ensure their accuracy and thoroughness.
</section><br>
<section class = "textblock" id = "text-block-issues">
	<h3>ISSUES</h3>
		<h4 class = "faq-entry" style = "margin-top: 0px;">"[SEATOSEA] I see 'PingNone' signals with a '?' symbol in the PDA. What is going on?"</h4>
		This is caused by adding the mod to an existing world. As the mod is a progression overhaul, this is something that does not make sense and should not be done. As a result, issues that arise from doing so are not a priority.
</section><br>
<section class = "textblock" id = "text-block-questions">
	<h3>QUESTIONS</h3>
		<h4 class = "faq-entry" style = "margin-top: 0px;">"Will you make mods for Below Zero?"</h4>
		I have no plans to do so. For one, I enjoy it far less than the original game, meaning there is much less motivation to spend time adding content to it, given how much less use I would get out of it. Secondly, this is a rather widespread opinion, meaning any mod for BZ is going to be similarly less valued to the general public. Finally, the BZ game is just shorter and shallower than the original, meaning there is less content to extend and build upon with modding.
		<h4 class = "faq-entry" style = "margin-top: 18px;">"[SEATOSEA] Does Sea to Sea work with other major SN mods?"</h4>
		There should be no mods it programatically conflicts with; you should be able to install it and launch the game alongside any other complement of mods. From a <i>progression</i> standpoint, however, it is likely to have at least minor conflicts with other similar progression overhauls, particularly that which add similar gating mechanics, or which substantially change various recipe trees.At the time of this writing, there is one such known conflict between Sea to Sea and the Return of the Ancients mod, as both make use of the deprecated-from-vanilla white and red precursor tablets. This is far from unfixable, and options to maintain progression in both mods, while keeping thematic design, are being considered.
		<h4 class = "faq-entry" style = "margin-top: 18px;">"[SEATOSEA] Will the progression be configurable?"</h4>
		No. At this time, that is not reasonably implementable. All recipe and worldgen modifications are done during the initial game load, which is after the user can access settings menus. Moreover, these settings menus do not have functionality to force a game restart when changed, meaning that they would likely not be able to take effect until a subsequent game load, after a save has already begun.
</section><br>
<section class = "textblock" id = "text-block-commentary">
	<h3>COMMENTARY</h3>
		<h4 class = "faq-entry" style = "margin-top: 0px;">"[SEATOSEA] You should put the Shadow Leviathan in the new biome."</h4>
		As amazingly as it would fit, this is not legally possible. UWE has expressly forbidden "backporting" BZ features to the base game, so unless that stance changes with proof in writing, adding BZ creatures to a base SN mod is not an option. If you are a UWE representative able to give such permission, I eagerly await this.

		If you like any of my mods, maps, or other content, or want to help me develop them, feel free to use my Patreon or the buttons below. Every little bit helps me be able to keep working on them, and helps ensure both maintenance and expansion of them.<br>
		If you wish to give a one-time donation, I recommend you use the Paypal link on the right; Patreon, though it can be used for one-time donations, is designed for ongoing monthly 'subscriptions' (ie a set amount of money gifted each month for as long as you remain a 'patron'). Paypal can also register a donation with monthly recurrence, should that seem preferable to you.<br>
		For both systems, the amount you choose to donate is up to you, and for Patreon, can be changed at any time should you wish to decrease or increase the amount.<br>
		And thank you for your support. :D<br>
