				<h3>Overview</h3>
					
					This section of the site contains information, additional resources, and links to Steam for my Portal maps.
					
					
					<br><br>
					
					
					Due to the sheer number of maps, they do not each have their own page; instead, they are sorted by year. As it happened that every time I started applying new techniques, skills, and styles was with a new year, this also ends up sorting them by those things as well. There are also a number of pages for general information pertaining to questions, policy information, and so on.

			<section class = "textblock" id = "text-block-importantnotes">
				<h3>Important Notes</h3>
					
					Updating Portal maps, especially the larger maps or ones full of Hammer work, and even more so if it is not the most recent, is a huge pain to do and often fails to work correctly; as a result, I generally try to avoid it unless a map is brand new or a major issue is found. Exploits arising from difficult-to-execute "ninja" moves or abuse of bugs, aesthetic considerations, or rendering/optimization errors, are not major.

		If you wish to give a one-time donation, I recommend you use the Paypal link on the right; Patreon, though it can be used for one-time donations, is designed for ongoing monthly 'subscriptions' (ie a set amount of money gifted each month for as long as you remain a 'patron'). Paypal can also register a donation with monthly recurrence, should that seem preferable to you.<br>
		For both systems, the amount you choose to donate is up to you, and for Patreon, can be changed at any time should you wish to decrease or increase the amount.<br>
