		If you like any of my mods, maps, or other content, or want to help me develop them, feel free to use my Patreon or the buttons below. Every little bit helps me be able to keep working on them, and helps ensure both maintenance and expansion of them.<br>
		If you wish to give a one-time donation, I recommend you use the Paypal link on the right; Patreon, though it can be used for one-time donations, is designed for ongoing monthly 'subscriptions' (ie a set amount of money gifted each month for as long as you remain a 'patron'). Paypal can also register a donation with monthly recurrence, should that seem preferable to you.<br>
		For both systems, the amount you choose to donate is up to you, and for Patreon, can be changed at any time should you wish to decrease or increase the amount.<br>
		And thank you for your support. :D<br>
