				<h3>Overview</h3>
					Satisforestry recreates the beautiful and memorable Pink Forest (usually called "Red Bamboo Fields" in official maps and discussions) at the center of the Satisfactory map. Unlike in that game, where the entire map was hand crafted, here it is a proper procedurally generated biome, with seed-based randomization and ability to generate infinitely.
					<br><br>
					I went to great lengths to reproduce as many of the defining characteristics of the biome as I could, from the foliage - large and small - to the terrain shaping to the kinds of creatures you find in the biome. The dominant feature is of course the giant pink trees - these rise from the plateau to scrape the world height limit, and make the biome visible from an extremely large distance. Under the canopy of giant trees are smaller, thinner pink trees, as well as scatted patches of red bamboo. Running through the biome is a web of sandy paths, sometimes crossing or becoming small streams.<br>
					<div class = "block-image">
	<a href = "../../imagedownloads/i-imgur-com_2FOgGoI2f.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class = "deembed-media" src = "../../imagedownloads/i-imgur-com_2FOgGoI2f.jpg" style="max-width:75%;" ></a>
</div>
					<br><br>
					These streams ultimately run off the edge of the biome, forming giant waterfalls. Also found scattered around the biome are outcrops of dark stone, poison "holey" rocks, and paleberries.<br>
					<div class = "block-image">
	<a href = "../../imagedownloads/i-imgur-com_2FtgxNyPB.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class = "deembed-media" src = "../../imagedownloads/i-imgur-com_2FtgxNyPB.jpg" style="max-width:75%;" ></a>
</div>
					<br><br>
					Note that several of the biome features are dependent upon finding a biome edge, and as such you will not see all of them in a single-biome world like a MystCraft age with pages for just this biome.
			</section><br>
			<section class = "textblock" id = "text-block-biomeregions">
				<h3>Biome Regions</h3>
					Just like the Satisfactory version, the Pink Birch Forest is split into three subzones; the main one, by far the most common, is the standard pink forest, with wide sandy paths and a mix of all foliage (except for the "Red Jungle" short and wide tree variant, with hanging vines). Within that you will find regions of a more swampy area, with terraced ponds, reproducing the similar area on the eastern edge of the SF biome. Finally, you will also find dense stands of red bamboo with comparatively few trees (including occasional Red Jungle trees), with narrow winding paths and numerous small cliffs, which replicate the area at the northwest of the SF biome.<br>

</div>
			</section><br>
			<section class = "textblock" id = "text-block-climate">
				<h3>Climate</h3>
					The pink forest is designated with a unique climatic model - its ambient temperature is marked as between cool and cold - marginally above the freezing point of water - but the biome will receive snow instead of rain, and said snow will accumulate. However, aside from a window around Christmas time, when all the mods have the seasonal effects in place, this snow will melt again as soon as it is both daylight and sunny.
			</section><br>
			<section class = "textblock" id = "text-block-creatures">
				<h3>Creatures</h3>
					In the day, the Pink Forest will seem mostly the same as most other biomes, with one prominent exception: Spiders can spawn at any light level in this biome. This actually makes the biome somewhat safer during the day, as spiders are nonaggressive in daylight, and their spawns on the surface reduce available slots for mobs underground or in other dark locations. However, come nightfall, those spiders will turn aggressive, and will be joined by another variant, based on the green Elite Stinger from Satisfactory. Bright green and with fluorescent yellow highlights - and trailing more of the same - these share the stinger's ability to leap large distances, emit clouds of poison, and deal serious damage. They also somewhat larger, have nearly double the health, and are not passivated by light. Should you not only survive but manage to defeat one, they will drop notably better resources than a vanilla spider.<br>
					<div class = "block-image">
	<a href = "../../imagedownloads/i-imgur-com_2FhpzECfv.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class = "deembed-media" src = "../../imagedownloads/i-imgur-com_2FhpzECfv.jpg" style="max-width:75%;" ></a>
</div>
					<br><br>
					However, not all the creatures in the biome are dangerous. Each region of pink forest will have a giant flying manta circling around it; aside from occasionally making noises, it can be ridden to receive a tour of the surrounding area.<br>
					<div class = "video">
	<iframe class = "deembed-media" style = "max-width: 75%;" width="960" height="540" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bODtRgxmJZA" title="The flying manta" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
					<br><br>
					Finally, and probably most popular, a few locations in the biome are marked as "Lizard Doggo Spawn Points", which will generate wild lizard doggo mobs. These will flee the player - unless holding paleberries, of course - and can be tamed. In addition to just being cute, tame doggos can occasionally find random items for the player - much the same as their SF counterparts.<br>

			<section class = "textblock" id = "text-block-buriedsecrets">
				<h3>Buried Secrets</h3>
					Like the pink forest in Satisfactory, there is a large tunnel system running under the biome, one which contains a "resource node", which can provide an inexhaustible - though not high-throughput - supply of whatever resource it is configured to do so. Of course, getting there and utilizing it may not be quite so trivial...<br>
					<div class = "block-image">
	<a href = "../../imagedownloads/i-imgur-com_2Fys26HQK.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class = "deembed-media" src = "../../imagedownloads/i-imgur-com_2Fys26HQK.jpg" style="max-width:75%;" ></a>	<a href = "../../imagedownloads/i-imgur-com_2F4nJ2bPe.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class = "deembed-media" src = "../../imagedownloads/i-imgur-com_2F4nJ2bPe.jpg" style="max-width:75%;" ></a>
</div>
			</section><br>
			<section class = "textblock" id = "text-block-configurability">
				<h3>Configurability</h3>
					Satisforestry makes extensive use of the <a href="../../minecraft\pages\info\luablock.html">LuaBlock</a> system to define many properties, including which ores will be used to generate deposits around the biome border and in the caves, what the resource nodes produce, and how they produce it, and the random items lizard doggos can find (and under what conditions). It ships with default configs, but these were <i>not</i> intended for serious play; they are not likely to be well-balanced or thematically appropriate. These configs are found under <code>/config/Satisforestry_Files</code>.

		If you like any of my mods, maps, or other content, or want to help me develop them, feel free to use my Patreon or the buttons below. Every little bit helps me be able to keep working on them, and helps ensure both maintenance and expansion of them.<br>
		If you wish to give a one-time donation, I recommend you use the Paypal link on the right; Patreon, though it can be used for one-time donations, is designed for ongoing monthly 'subscriptions' (ie a set amount of money gifted each month for as long as you remain a 'patron'). Paypal can also register a donation with monthly recurrence, should that seem preferable to you.<br>
		For both systems, the amount you choose to donate is up to you, and for Patreon, can be changed at any time should you wish to decrease or increase the amount.<br>
		And thank you for your support. :D<br>
