				<h3>Overview</h3>
					
					Satisforestry recreates the beautiful and memorable Pink Forest (usually called "Red Bamboo Fields" in official maps and discussions) at the center of the Satisfactory map. Unlike in that game, where the entire map was hand crafted, here it is a proper procedurally generated biome, with seed-based randomization and ability to generate infinitely.
					
					
					<br><br>
					
					
					I went to great lengths to reproduce as many of the defining characteristics of the biome as I could, from the foliage - large and small - to the terrain shaping to the kinds of creatures you find in the biome. The dominant feature is of course the giant pink trees - these rise from the plateau to scrape the world height limit, and make the biome visible from an extremely large distance. Under the canopy of giant trees are smaller, thinner pink trees, as well as scatted patches of red bamboo. Running through the biome is a web of sandy paths, sometimes crossing or becoming small streams.<br>
					
					
					<div class = "block-image">
	<a href = "../../imagedownloads/i-imgur-com_2FOgGoI2f.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class = "deembed-media" src = "../../imagedownloads/i-imgur-com_2FOgGoI2f.jpg" style="max-width:75%;" ></a>
</div><br>
					
					
					These streams ultimately run off the edge of the biome, forming giant waterfalls. Also found scattered around the biome are outcrops of dark stone, poison "holey" rocks, and paleberries.<br>
					
					
					<div class = "block-image">
	<a href = "../../imagedownloads/i-imgur-com_2FtgxNyPB.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class = "deembed-media" src = "../../imagedownloads/i-imgur-com_2FtgxNyPB.jpg" style="max-width:75%;" ></a>
</div><br>
					
					
					Additionally, some of the more valuable finds in the biome are guarded by mobs, and these mobs are not passive, even in full daylight, and often also include ones which are not normally found elsewhere. However, these "guard mobs" are generally confined to a small area and once cleared, will never respawn.
					
					
					<br><br>
					
					
					Note that several of the biome features are dependent upon finding a biome edge, and as such you will not see all of them in a single-biome world like a MystCraft age with pages for just this biome.

			<section class = "textblock" id = "text-block-biomeregions">
				<h3>Biome Regions</h3>
					
					Just like the Satisfactory version, the Pink Birch Forest is split into three subzones; the main one, by far the most common, is the standard pink forest, with wide sandy paths and a mix of all foliage (except for the "Red Jungle" short and wide tree variant, with hanging vines). Within that you will find regions of a more swampy area, with terraced ponds, reproducing the similar area on the eastern edge of the SF biome. Finally, you will also find dense stands of red bamboo with comparatively few trees (including occasional Red Jungle trees), with narrow winding paths and numerous small cliffs, which replicate the area at the northwest of the SF biome.<br>

			</section><br>
			<section class = "textblock" id = "text-block-climate">
				<h3>Climate</h3>
					
					The pink forest is designated with a unique climatic model - its ambient temperature is marked as between cool and cold - marginally above the freezing point of water - but the biome will receive snow instead of rain, and said snow will accumulate. However, aside from a window around Christmas time, when all the mods have the seasonal effects in place, this snow will melt again as soon as it is both daylight and sunny.

				<h3>Creatures</h3>
					<section class = "textblock" id = "text-block-creatures-autosub-spidersandstingers">
					<h4>Spiders And Stingers</h4>
					
					
					In the day, the Pink Forest will seem mostly the same as most other biomes, with one prominent exception: Spiders can spawn at any light level in this biome. This actually makes the biome somewhat safer during the day, as spiders are (usually) nonaggressive in daylight, and their spawns on the surface reduce available slots for mobs underground or in other dark locations. However, come nightfall, those spiders will turn aggressive, and will be joined by another variant, based on the green Elite Stinger from Satisfactory. Bright green and with fluorescent yellow highlights - and trailing more of the same - these share the stinger's ability to leap large distances, emit clouds of poison, and deal serious damage. Compared to vanilla spiders, they are somewhat larger, have nearly double the health, and are not passivated by light. Should you not only survive but manage to defeat one, they will drop notably better resources than a vanilla spider.<br>

					<section class = "textblock" id = "text-block-creatures-autosub-spitters">
					<h4>Spitters</h4>
					
					
					Spitters are a special kind of mob, unique not only to the forest but to guarding valuables and chokepoints. Spitters are fast-moving quadrupedal creatures with a ranged fireball attack, and can detect the player from a significant distance. Spitters usually occur in packs, making them even more dangerous, as dodging all of them simultaneously becomes nearly impossible.<br>

</div><br>
					
					
					Near especially high-value items, spitters can exist in larger, more aggressive "Alpha" forms, which boast not only markedly more health and better senses, but also special far more dangerous attacks that are both more damaging and much harder to avoid.<br>

					<h4>Giant Flying Manta</h4>
					
					
					However, not all the creatures in the biome are dangerous. Each region of pink forest will have a giant flying manta circling around it; aside from occasionally making noises, it can be ridden to receive a tour of the surrounding area.<br>

					<h4>Lizard Doggo</h4>
					
					
					Finally, and probably most popular, a few locations in the biome are marked as "Lizard Doggo Spawn Points", which will generate wild lizard doggo mobs. These will flee the player - unless holding paleberries, of course - and can be tamed. In addition to just being cute, tame doggos can occasionally find random items for the player - much the same as their SF counterparts.<br>

				<h3>Power Slugs</h3>
					
					Scattered around the forest are large glowing slugs filled with strange energy. Based on the Satisfactory power slugs, these can be found at or near the ground level, in caves, on tree trunks, and high in the canopy. Most of the time, these will be difficult to access, either because of their height or obscurity, or because the surrounding area is guarded by creatures or poison gas. More difficult or dangerous areas tend to contain better types of slugs, with the rarest purple being rarely found without significant investigation or serious danger.<br>

				<h3>Buried Secrets</h3>
					
					Like the pink forest in Satisfactory, there is a large tunnel system running under the biome, one which contains a "resource node", which can provide an inexhaustible - though not high-throughput - supply of whatever resource it is configured to. Just as with their Satisfactory counterparts, these resource nodes can occur in varying purity levels - Impure, Normal, and Pure - which influence both their yield and potentially what items they may provide. Of course, this is a moot point if you cannot find the node and put it to use, something that may not be quite so trivial...<br>

				<h3>Resource Node Extractor</h3>
					
					The resource node in the cave cannot be harvested via the usual means. While manual mining will (slowly) extract small quantities of resources, not all the possible yields - in type or quantity - can be obtained that way. To do this, a multiblock miner structure is required, and will require power, either RF, EU, or <a href="../../minecraft/mods/rotarycraft.html">RotaryCraft</a> shaft power depending on the type of controller block. All types have three upgrade slots, allowing for 150%, 200%, and 250% operational speed (at much greater power cost) respectively, with appropriate overclocker/speed upgrade items. Power slugs also function as upgrades, with green, yellow, and purple counting as one, two, and three upgrades respectively.<br>

				<h3>Configurability</h3>
					
					Satisforestry makes extensive use of the <a href="../../minecraft/pages/info/luablock.html">LuaBlock</a> system to define prototypes to dictate many behaviors. It ships with default configs, but these were <i>not</i> intended for serious play; they are not likely to be well-balanced or thematically appropriate, and were simply created to both provide the ability to use the mod as downloaded and to provide example definitions. These files are found in <code>Reika/Satisforestry_Files</code> in the config folder.
					
					
					<br><br>
					
					
					This folder has four files: <code>example</code>, <code>ores</code>, <code>resources</code>, and <code>doggo</code>. The first of these simply includes a sample value of each kind of prototypes (consisting of the combined content of the default values for the other three files), and is not meant to be edited. The other three files define the types and amounts of ores that will spawn within the biome and where they may spawn, what the resource nodes produce and how they produce it, and the random items lizard doggos can find and under what conditions.
					
			</section><br>
			<section class = "textblock" id = "text-block-oreconfiguration">
				<h3>Ore Configuration</h3>
					
					An ore prototype defines one kind of ore, including what block(s) it generates with, and in which locations it can generate and with what amounts in each. Aside from <code>type</code>, only two tags are required. The first is the ore block definition, using <i>either</i> a single string value for <code>block</code> or a list of strings for <code>blocks</code>, for defining ore entries with a single or multiple ore blocks respectively. The second tag, <code>spawnLocations</code>, defines which of the predetermined locations where ore clusters may appear can select this ore entry and what modifiers to apply on the generation of this ore in this location. This tag is a list of tables, each of which defines three child values:<br>

					Satisforestry can load the Satisfactory soundtrack from disk to play in the biome, in place of the default MC soundtrack. To do this, create a folder somewhere on your system and specify this location in the <code>Satisfactory OST Folder</code> config setting. In that folder, create five subfolders: "all", "day", "morning", "night", and "evening". Place the various tracks into one or more of the folders to categorize them, and the mod will select from them at the appropriate times of day. The ogg filetype is the only supported by default, but with the <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/notenoughcodecs/files">Not Enough Codecs</a> mod, you can also use MP3 and .flac audio formats (though the latter will require a 1.7.10 backport of newer versions, available <a href="https://gregtech.overminddl1.com/openmods/codecs/NotEnoughCodecs/1.7.10-0.6/NotEnoughCodecs-1.7.10-0.6.jar">here</a>).

		If you like any of my mods, maps, or other content, or want to help me develop them, feel free to use my Patreon or the buttons below. Every little bit helps me be able to keep working on them, and helps ensure both maintenance and expansion of them.<br>
		If you wish to give a one-time donation, I recommend you use the Paypal link on the right; Patreon, though it can be used for one-time donations, is designed for ongoing monthly 'subscriptions' (ie a set amount of money gifted each month for as long as you remain a 'patron'). Paypal can also register a donation with monthly recurrence, should that seem preferable to you.<br>
		For both systems, the amount you choose to donate is up to you, and for Patreon, can be changed at any time should you wish to decrease or increase the amount.<br>
		And thank you for your support. :D<br>
