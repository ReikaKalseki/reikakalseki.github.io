						<section class = "textblock" id = "text-block-license">
				<h3>License</h3>
					<b>Downloading any of my mods constitutes a complete and unconditional agreement with these terms!</b>
					<br><br>
					As is necessity, I reserve the right to make changes to these terms at any time and grant exceptions if I so desire.<br>
					All permissions and exceptions are non-transferrable and revocable.<br>
					The terms only apply so long as you actually use and/or own copies of the mods; if you wish to terminate the agreement with these conditions, you may do so by uninstalling the mods and deleting the downloads.
					<br><br>
					In the event that any clause or part thereof of this license proves unenforceable or invalid, it will be replaced by the closest usable variant, or removed if no such possibility exists. Under no circumstances does the failure of one part of this license impact the remainder.
			</section><br>
			<section class = "textblock" id = "text-block-0.usedterms">
				<h3>0. USED TERMS</h3>
					<ul><li>MOD - modification, plugin, a piece of software that interfaces with the Minecraft client to extend, add, change or remove original capabilities.</li>
					<li>MOJANG - Mojang AB (Sweden)</li>
					<li>OWNER - Original author(s) of the mod. Under <a href="https://account.mojang.com/documents/minecraft_eula">the copyright terms accepted when purchasing Minecraft</a> the owner has full rights over their mod despite use of Mojang code.</li>
					<li>SOURCE (CODE) - The written code which is compiled into the usable released files.</li>
					<li>API - A section of the code for a mod which is intended to allow some level of inter-mod interactions without creating hard dependencies on the mod proper.</li>
					<li>MOD CODE - All code in a project which is not part of the API, containing the actual implementations of the content.</li>
					<li>USER - End user of the mod, i.e., the person installing the mod.</li>
					<li>SPOTLIGHT - A "feature" or "review" of a mod, where the creator shows and discusses that mod; this may be a YouTube video, blog post, or many other formats.</li>
					<li>PRIVATE - Personal use, accessible to a singular person.</li>
					<li>PUBLIC - Any usage that involves more than one person.</li></ul>
			</section><br>
			<section class = "textblock" id = "text-block-1.liability">
				<h3>1. LIABILITY</h3>
					These mods are provided 'as is' with no warranties, implied or otherwise. The owner of these mods takes no responsibility for any damages incurred from the use of these mods. These mods alters fundamental parts of the Minecraft game, and as such parts of Minecraft may not work as intended with these mods installed. All damages caused from the use or misuse of these mods fall on the user.
			</section><br>
			<section class = "textblock" id = "text-block-2.use">
				<h3>2. USE</h3>
					These mods may be used for the purpose of enhancing your gameplay or pack creation as you see fit. Additionally, DragonAPI may be used as the foundation to create other mods, but you do not gain ownership or control over DragonAPI by doing so. API Code may be used (and if necessary, included) in any mod wishing to interact with these mods. These mods may not be used to generate profit, circumvent the law, or other use contrary to their original function.
			</section><br>
			<section class = "textblock" id = "text-block-3.redistribution">
				<h3>3. REDISTRIBUTION</h3>
					Except where the granting of such permission is explicitly required by the Minecraft terms of use, these mods may not be uploaded or mirrored by anyone other than the owner, and all links to these mods must link to this site, not directly to adfly, MediaFire, or Curse. Any unauthorized links to the mods that bypass this page will be discovered and forced to be deleted.
			</section><br>
			<section class = "textblock" id = "text-block-4.derivativeworks">
				<h3>4. DERIVATIVE WORKS</h3>
					These mods are provided freely and may be decompiled and modified for <b>private</b> use, either with a decompiler or a bytecode editor. Public use of modified or derivative versions is prohibited unless you are given specific written permission. Distribution of the mod code, modified (including custom compilation) or otherwise, is <b>prohibited</b> by anyone except the author, except in the case of a derivative mod that has been given prior approval. <b>Creating derivative works for commercial use is expressly forbidden and the owner reserves full right to seek damages.</b>
			</section><br>
			<section class = "textblock" id = "text-block-addons|addons">
				<h3>5. ADDONS AND MODIFICATIONS</h3>
					Addons and modifications that use none of my mods' source code can be made and released freely and distributed as the creator sees fit. However, if I feel an addon or modification's sole purpose is to damage one of my mods - such as by hurting its compatibility with other mods, breaking features, damaging the balance or fundamentally damaging how it was designed - I reserve the right to revoke this permission and prevent it from being used in conjunction with my mods.
			</section><br>
			<section class = "textblock" id = "text-block-6.monetization">
				<h3>6. MONETIZATION</h3>
					With the sole exception of spotlights, which may collect revenue via the normal means for the applicable platform (eg YouTube ads), any attempts to make money off of these mods (selling, selling modified/derivative versions, adfly, sharecash, donations, ad revenue, etc.) are <b>strictly forbidden</b>, and the owner may claim damages or take other action to rectify the situation. Servers hosting the pack may take donations to cover operating costs, but not for personal profit. Additionally, the mods' behaviors may not be edited - such as by making some items unobtainable - to encourage or coerce players to pay or donate to the pack or server host. <b>These actions are also expressly forbidden by the MineCraft terms of use.</b>
			</section><br>
			<section class = "textblock" id = "text-block-7.licensing">
				<h3>7. LICENSING</h3>
					You must agree to the entirety of this license in full in order to use the mods or include it in a pack. <b>Use of the mods constitutes implicit and unconditional agreement to these terms.</b><br>
					The author of these mods reserves the right to change this license as is deemed necessary without prior warning, though such warning may and likely will be provided at the author's discretion. Such changes take effect immediately; it is not required to explicitly agree nor update the mods.
			</section><br>
			<section class = "textblock" id = "text-block-8.cost">
				<h3>8. COST</h3>
					This software is provided free of charge for all users. <b>If you obtained this software from any other source, or paid money to access it, you have been scammed. Get a refund immediately, and report the scammer to me.</b>
			</section><br>
			<section class = "textblock" id = "text-block-9.dragonapi-basedmods">
				<h3>9. DRAGONAPI-BASED MODS</h3>
					DragonAPI has always been written with the intent that anyone can use it to build upon for their own mods, much the same as I do. However, doing so comes with the following caveats and restrictions:
					<ul><li>You do not gain any ownership or control over any of DragonAPI by making a mod with it; you retain full ownership of your own mod only.</li>
					<li>DragonAPI does sometimes make changes that may require you modify your code to continue functioning.</li>
					<li>You may not ship or include DragonAPI source code or compiled JAR files in any released version of your product. Simply require the user to install DragonAPI normally.</li>
					<li>You may not host copies of DragonAPI for download. Direct the user to the appropriate download locations that they would normally use.</li>
					<li>You may not enter a mod built on DragonAPI into a competition such as ModJam.</li>
					<li>You must not hide the fact that your mod is built upon DragonAPI.</li>
					<li>Your mod must not attempt to interfere with the normal functioning of DragonAPI in such a way that it would cause problems in other mods using it.</li></ul>

		If you like any of my mods, maps, or other content, or want to help me develop them, feel free to use my Patreon or the buttons below. Every little bit helps me be able to keep working on them, and helps ensure both maintenance and expansion of them.<br>
		If you wish to give a one-time donation, I recommend you use the Paypal link on the right; Patreon, though it can be used for one-time donations, is designed for ongoing monthly 'subscriptions' (ie a set amount of money gifted each month for as long as you remain a 'patron'). Paypal can also register a donation with monthly recurrence, should that seem preferable to you.<br>
		For both systems, the amount you choose to donate is up to you, and for Patreon, can be changed at any time should you wish to decrease or increase the amount.<br>
		And thank you for your support. :D<br>
