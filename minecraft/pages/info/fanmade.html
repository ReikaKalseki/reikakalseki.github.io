<h3>Fanmade Content</h3>
	There are currently no such items to display.<br><br>
</section>

<section class = "textblock" id = "text-block-submissions">
<h3>Submissions</h3>
If you wish to submit your own fanmade content for featuring on this site, contact me with your proposal, including a way for me to see the proposed content as you wish it to appear, and a statement of whether you are seeking a simple link to your own page or for the content to be directly embedded into this page.
<br><br>
To be considered, your content must be focused on one or more mods, reasonably novel, and not designed to in some way subvert the mod's intentions (gameplay or otherwise) in some way. It must also be "appropriate", in that it not be offensive, contain illegal material (including copyrighted work), or similar.
<br><br>
Examples of content that are likely to be approved or rejected, and why:
<ul>
<li><img class = "inlineicon" src = "../../../images/check.png"> A piece of art you made (painting, digital, etc) of something from my content - practically guaranteed approval if you actually made it</li>
<li><img class = "inlineicon" src = "../../../images/check.png"> A piece of art based upon my content some way (like a lot of "fan music videos" you see for games) - almost guaranteed approval barring unusual circumstances</li>
<li><img class = "inlineicon" src = "../../../images/check.png"> Use of my content in a setting outside the context of the game (eg discussing it in an academic work, or its use as an educational tool) - almost guaranteed approval in most cases</li>
<li><img class = "inlineicon" src = "../../../images/check.png"> A creative-writing project told from an in-universe perspective - almost guaranteed approval if content-appropriate</li>
<li><img class = "inlineicon" src = "../../../images/maybe.png"> Derivatives of the mod - variable<ul><li>For things like a build blueprint it may be approved if sufficiently unique, but unlikely in most cases</li></ul></li>
<li><img class = "inlineicon" src = "../../../images/x.png"> A build showcase - unlikely to be approved<ul><li>Unlikely to be novel, but may potentially be innovative or dramatic enough</li></ul></li>
<li><img class = "inlineicon" src = "../../../images/x.png"> A simple progression guide - very unlikely to be approved<ul><li>Lack of uniqueness</li><li>Potential reduction of gameplay to a checklist</li></ul></li>
</ul>
When you submit a proposal for content for me to include, I will review it to determine if it is appropriate for inclusion, and if not what changes could be made to correct this if possible. Assuming that it passes this, I will then add it here when I am able to do so. I can make no guarantees of timing on that front; my responses and inclusion may be immediate, or may be - in an extreme case - delayed by many weeks, depending on the current demands on my time.
<br><br>
Note that if you want your content to be included directly on this page, rather than a link to your own page, I will be more stringent about the requirements and potential issues. Additionally, any referenced media - such as images - that are involved will need to be hosted on a platform of your choosing that allows me to hotlink them here (which is <i>not</i> permitted by most online image hosts such as imgur), and you will need to provide proof that this is permitted, usually by way of explict mentions of this fact in their terms of service.
<br><br>
I reserve the right to remove content as I deem necessary, though I will try to make an effort to prevent that from becoming necessary where reasonably possible.

		If you like any of my mods, maps, or other content, or want to help me develop them, feel free to use my Patreon or the buttons below. Every little bit helps me be able to keep working on them, and helps ensure both maintenance and expansion of them.<br>
		If you wish to give a one-time donation, I recommend you use the Paypal link on the right; Patreon, though it can be used for one-time donations, is designed for ongoing monthly 'subscriptions' (ie a set amount of money gifted each month for as long as you remain a 'patron'). Paypal can also register a donation with monthly recurrence, should that seem preferable to you.<br>
		For both systems, the amount you choose to donate is up to you, and for Patreon, can be changed at any time should you wish to decrease or increase the amount.<br>
		And thank you for your support. :D<br>
