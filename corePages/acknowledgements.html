				<h3>Thanks</h3>
					
					Projects of the scale I work on could not be realized alone; three key groups of people were and remain critical to making them viable:
					
			</section><br>
			<section class = "textblock" id = "text-block-gamestudios">
				<h3>1</h3>
					
					The companies making the various games - without a game to modify or make content for, the whole act of doing so rather ceases to exist. As such I extend thanks to all the companies who created the games I enjoy and made it possible to expand upon them like I do.
					
			</section><br>
			<section class = "textblock" id = "text-block-othercontentcreators">
				<h3>2</h3>
					
					Other developers of addons and tools, whose work both tends to be the primary material with which to learn from, as well as helping create the overall addon ecosystem that helps sustain my work. As any player knows, a single map or mod in isolation is not all that fun to play, especially not for any real length of time, but with hundreds or even thousands of them, that keeps the community vibrant and alive.
					
			</section><br>
			<section class = "textblock" id = "text-block-players">
				<h3>3</h3>
					
					Last but not least: You. The players. Making something for oneself is all well and good, but in most cases the motivation to continue cannot be sustained indefinitely in that environment; seeing others enjoy one's work makes up for that. This goes doubly or triply for those of you who go even further and directly help me continue, not just financially, but also with things like helping find and solve issues and spreading good word of mouth.

		If you like any of my mods, maps, or other content, or want to help me develop them, feel free to use my Patreon or the buttons below. Every little bit helps me be able to keep working on them, and helps ensure both maintenance and expansion of them.<br>
		If you wish to give a one-time donation, I recommend you use the Paypal link on the right; Patreon, though it can be used for one-time donations, is designed for ongoing monthly 'subscriptions' (ie a set amount of money gifted each month for as long as you remain a 'patron'). Paypal can also register a donation with monthly recurrence, should that seem preferable to you.<br>
		For both systems, the amount you choose to donate is up to you, and for Patreon, can be changed at any time should you wish to decrease or increase the amount.<br>
		And thank you for your support. :D<br>
